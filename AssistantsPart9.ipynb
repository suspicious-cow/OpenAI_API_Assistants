Known for their distinctive black and white plumage, penguins have streamlined bodies adapted for swimming and waddle awkwardly on land. They are excellent swimmers, using their flippers to propel through water, where they hunt for fish, krill, and squid. Penguins are social birds, often forming large colonies for breeding and nesting. They endure extreme cold with their dense feathers and a layer of blubber. There are several species of penguins, varying in size and features, such as the Emperor, King, and Adelie penguins.'), type='text')]\n",
